    abstract = {An algorithm is given for computing the incomplete gamma function ratios $P(a, x)$ and $Q(a, x)$ for $a \geq 0$, $x \geq 0$, $a + x \neq 0$. Temme's uniform asymptotic expansions are used. The algorithm is robust; results accurate to 14 significant digits can be obtained. An' extensive set of coefficients for the Temme expansions is included. An algorithm, employing third-order Schr√∂der iteration supported by Newton-Raphson iteration, is provided for computing $x$ when $a$, $P(a, x)$, and $Q(a, x)$ are given. Three iterations at most are required to obtain 10 significant digit accuracy for $x$.},
